# GUI for the KLab

Repository under construction :)

TO DO:
* Create efficient saver/loader functions to save the processed data after the use of the class "Measurement"
* Finish Auto Watcher
* Add a non auto watcher: ypu select folder and it just monitors that one. (Also loads existing save data)


### Future Ideas
